# The .bat file for executing Unix scripts in Windows

Just rename our `script.bat` to `<yourname>.bat` and put the corresponding Unix script `<yourname>.sh` into the same directory. The .bat file will install Cygwin and execute your .sh script as if you were in Linux/Unix. Command-line arguments given to the .bat script will be forwared to the .sh script.
